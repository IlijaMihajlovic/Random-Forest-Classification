This project demonstrates how to build a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict music genres using audio feature data from Spotify.  
The model is trained on a curated subset of the `spotify_tracks.csv` dataset, focusing on popular genres such as **pop**, **country**, **hip-hop**, **rock**, **latin**, **edm** and more.
